//1. Write a function that takes two numbers (a and b) as argument
// Sum a and b
// Return the result
var myFunction = function (a, b) {
    return 
}


//2. Write a function that takes two values, say a and b, as arguments
// Return true if the two values are equal and of the same type
// Comparison operators, strict equality
var myFunction2 = function (a, b){
    return 
}


//3. Write a function that takes a value as argument
// Return the type of the value
var myFunction3 = function (a){
    return 
}

//4. write a function that takes as argument a number,
// a string, and an object
// display the values of the primitives (excluding the object)
var myFunction4 = function (a){
    return 
}

//5. write a Student class that has a constructor with
// name (will be a String), age (will be a Number), hobbies (will be an Array of Strings) e.g. ["Music", "Travel"]
// create a method name `greeting` that returns the sentence: Hello my name is {name} and I'm {age}.
class Student {

}

//6. write a Teacher class that has a constructor with
// name (will be a String), age (will be a Number)

//7. create two students (instances) of the class defined at 5
// console log their greetings
